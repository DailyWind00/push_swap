# push_swap âœ…84/100
Stack sorting

I used the radix sort algorithm for this program

- ![push_swap subject](fr.push_swap.subject.pdf)
 
My push_swap can be seen with the push_swap visualizer :
  - [Link to the push_swap visualizer github](https://github.com/o-reo/push_swap_visualizer)

To get the program, you must do these commands :
```shell
cd ft_printf
make
```

You also have these commands for cleaning the push_swap directory :
```shell
# Clean all object files (*.o)
make clean

# Clean static library & object files
make fclean

# Clean everything and recompile the static library
make re
```
